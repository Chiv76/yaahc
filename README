                 yet another adaptive huffman coding


    ~ What is adaptive huffman coding?

      Adaptive Huffman coding is an adaptive coding technique based on
      Huffman coding. It permits building the code as the symbols are
      being transmitted, having no initial knowledge of source distribution,
      that allows one-pass encoding and adaptation to changing conditions in
      data.


    ~ What is yaahc?

      yaahc is an easy C++ library that implements FGK algorithm of the
      adaptive huffman coding. The library was implemented special for
      university course of the compressing algorithms.


    ~ How to build?

      The library use the CMake tool for generating makefile. So you
      should do following commands:

        $ mkdir build/ && cd build/
        $ cmake ../
        $ make

      If you want to build tests, you should replace second command with next
      line:

        $ cmake ../ -DBUILD_TESTS=1

      Make sure Boost Testing Framework was installed before. Now you can
      run tests with following command:

        $ make tests
